# Original (Chinese)

- 记录每月工资，跟踪每月固定必需开销（房租、订阅服务等），分配每月可变必需开销（食品百货等）、可变可选开销（衣物、旅行等）与储蓄。
    - 储蓄包括银行的储蓄账户和各种理财产品。
        - 对我们而言，各种理财产品的职责首先是对抗通货膨胀的**储蓄账户**，而非盈利的手段——我们是斗不过高频交易算法的。不得花过多的时间经历关注理财产品的价格变化，严格禁止各种赌博心理。
- 充分利用各种税收和学费资助的“免费”服务：
    - 规划好行程，充分利用公共交通，少打车。
    - 充分利用学校提供的医疗保险；
    - 通过学校订购的在线课程，不断提升与科研需求相辅相成的实用技能，如网页前端开发、数据科学等，并获取相应证书，既提升我们欠缺的implementation能力，又方便找实习与工作等。
- 做好灵活的食品百货采货计划。
    - 关注超市传单；
    - 书包中常备购物袋；
    - 适量减少红肉采货量，适量增加鱼、蛋白粉、谷物、水果、蛋、奶采货量。

# Translation (DeepL.com)

- Record monthly paychecks, track monthly fixed essential expenses (rent, subscription services, etc.), and allocate monthly variable essential expenses (food, groceries, etc.) and variable optional expenses (clothing, travel, etc.) with savings.
 - Savings include savings accounts in banks and various financial products.
 - For us, the duty of various financial products is, first and foremost, an inflation-fighting **savings account**, not a means of profit - we can't beat high-frequency trading algorithms. We must not spend excessive time paying attention to price changes in financial products and strictly prohibit all kinds of gambling mentality.
- Take advantage of tax and tuition assistance "freebies":
 - Plan trips well, use public transportation, and take fewer cabs.
 - Take advantage of the school's health insurance;
 - Through online courses purchased by the school, improve practical skills that complement research needs, such as web front-end development, data science, etc., and obtain the appropriate certificates to improve our lack of implementation skills and facilitate the search for internships and jobs.
- Make a flexible food and grocery procurement plan.
 - Pay attention to supermarket flyers;
 - Always carry a shopping bag in your bag;
 - Reduce the amount of red meat and increase the amount of fish, protein powder, cereals, fruits, eggs, and milk.
