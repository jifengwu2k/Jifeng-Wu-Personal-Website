- Do the high-level, high-value [**requirements**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_engineering), [**analysis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_analysis), and [**design**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design) work in an *incremental* fashion while not sacrificing *rigor*.
- Maximize the utilization of *tools* that make coding, testing, and operations as *cheap, trivial, straightforward, and error-free* as possible, minimizing *technical debt*, including:
  - Generative AI tools like ChatGPT.
  - Functional Programming.
- A critique on both [the waterfall model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) and [the agile model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development).
