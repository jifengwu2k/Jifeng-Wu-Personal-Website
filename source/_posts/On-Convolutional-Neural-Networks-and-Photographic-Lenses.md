[Convolutional neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) are [camera lenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_lens) to a computer.

The analogy does not stop at the point that both compress visual information:

- The [evolution of convolutional neural network architectures](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/convnet-architectures/) resembles the [evolution of camera lenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_photographic_lens_design).
- The [P-R curve](https://analyticsindiamag.com/complete-guide-to-understanding-precision-and-recall-curves/) showing the performance of a convolutional neural network is strikingly similar to the [MTF curve](https://www.dearsusan.net/how-to-read-mtf-curves-like-an-artist/) evaluating lens performance.
