## [Linear Types for Systems Verification](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bv4_PnXXZfx6egG4htZNfNYES_gFhfR7/view?usp=share_link)

It is a good idea to embed verification information in type system of a programming language.

## [Verified Program Construction](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14XdepAsHM1ts-tp21UXAqMOEbsB8mkHG/view?usp=share_link)

- Program verification is hard per se.
  - Proofs are brittle.
  - Existing techniques provide poor support for commonly-used datatypes such as vectors, sets, and maps.
  - Partial verification is important due to the complexity of programs.
- Program verification for general-purpose programming languages and frameworks for general-purpose programming languages is tedious compared to focusing on a DSL.
- The direction for program verification should be *verified program construction*.
- Be aware of the pain point you are trying to solve and the day-to-day engineering reality in real-world software development.

## [Hot Takes on Machine Learning for Program Analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cfncXsqGw9kFHwi0BBE-VO7JkA1qY8eO/view?usp=share_link)

- A crucial step in Machine Learning for Program Analysis is deciding what things could be used as features based on experience.
- Generative AI can replace junior developers doing *raw coding* instead of *contextual work*.

If you don't use DSLs, FPGAs bring crappy performance running programs in general-purpose programming languages.

Retrofitting verification into non-verified languages is an arduous task.

## [An Anti-Capitalist, Multicultural, Accessible Programming Language](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OD9XlNAPLXTtYFzFY2mpRA-gCoLWFCic/view?usp=share_link)

An event-based language enabling time-traveling to all points in program execution history would greatly benefit debugging.
