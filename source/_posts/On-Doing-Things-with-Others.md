# Original (Chinese)

和别人一起做事的时候，如果遇到了某件说好了要做的事别人不愿意开始做，我们不应该面露难色，变得焦虑、愤怒；我们更好的做法应该是给对方一个善意的提醒，然后重新规划时间——这时候规划的时间必须具体，不能是大而化之的“之后”“再过几天”等。

# Translation (DeepL.com)

When doing things with others, if we encounter a certain thing that we said we would do that others are not willing to start doing, we should not look embarrassed, become anxious and angry; our better approach should be to give each other a kind reminder, and then re-planning time - this time the planning time must be specific, not a big and generalized "afterward," "a few more days," etc.
