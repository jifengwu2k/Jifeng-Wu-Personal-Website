- Firmly define the research topic.
- Do literature research based on keywords, never limit the scope of journals and conferences, and continue literature research even after starting the project.
- Collect baselines and benchmarks as soon as possible; make sure the baselines and benchmarks are downloaded and can be run.
- Focus on the NOVELTY of the core aspects; don't be perfect, and don't support all cases or possibilities.
- Find a few small examples that prove the power of your novelty, and emphasize it in both the paper and the presentation.
- Avoid designing overly complex rule-based systems.
- With GenAI, aim to get a prototype and an illustrative presentation out as soon as possible. This will allow you to collect feedback early, empowering you to make necessary adjustments and improvements.
- Use functional programming architecture that is easy to test. Conduct thorough unit testing, document the coverage, and leave traces of development step by step. This will provide a solid foundation and instill confidence in the robustness of your research.
- Insert breakpoints where you're unsure how to code. Figure out what to do when encountering them, and refine the unit tests in the process.
- Don't be perfect; start writing your thesis when you're almost done.
