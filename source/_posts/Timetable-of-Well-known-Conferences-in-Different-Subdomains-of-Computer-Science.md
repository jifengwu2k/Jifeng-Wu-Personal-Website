We have compiled a timetable of well-known conferences in different subdomains of computer science based on the *Class A* and *Class B* conferences in ["Directory of International Academic Conferences and Journals Recommended by the Chinese Computer Society"](https://www.ccf.org.cn/Academic_Evaluation/By_category/). Although the precise start dates of each conference vary year by year, the provided start dates provide a general guideline on the *relative order* of the conferences throughout each year.
