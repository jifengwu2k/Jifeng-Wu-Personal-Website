# Original (Chinese)

关于聊天的一点思考：

- 开始之前预定一个时间，设置一个时间上的边界感；时间上没有边界感容易让我们没话找话，寻找一些无聊的话题，让对方失去兴趣，甚至不断地因此而擦出矛盾来。
- 对方做得不对，我们要简明扼要地点出来，点到为止，然后换下一个话题；切忌在这种情况下，主动地理论、解释，尝试说服对方。

# Translation (DeepL.com)

Some thoughts about chatting:

- Before starting, arrange a time and set a sense of time boundaries. Lacking such a sense makes us constantly look for boring topics when we have nothing to say, which may lead to the other party losing interest and result in conflicts.
- If the other party is not doing right, we have to point it out succinctly, avoid being overly verbose, and then promptly change to the next topic; do not take the initiative to theorize, explain, and try to persuade the other party in this situation.
