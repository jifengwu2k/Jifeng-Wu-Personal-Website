# Original (Chinese)

导师在告诉我如何回答reviewers comments的时候曾经说过：“show, not tell”。意思是面对他们希望我们加baseline和metric的comments，在点到我们要加上他们之后，最好展现一些初步结果（比如说在部分数据集上评测那些baseline和metric），而不是一味地说服对方我们之后一定能加上去。

感觉这种思想用在日常生活中的说服上也是很值得借鉴的：在点出一件事之后，如果对方认可了，更好的做法是以身作则去示范他或者是展现自己怎么想，而不是一味地去说服对方应该怎么怎么做。

# Translation (DeepL.com)

My mentor once said "show, not tell" when he told me how to answer reviewers comments. The idea is that when faced with comments that they want us to add baselines and metrics to, it is better to show some preliminary results (e.g., evaluating those baselines and metrics on a part of the dataset) after pointing out that we want to add them to, instead of just convincing the other party that we will definitely be able to add them afterward.

I feel that this idea is also useful for persuasion in daily life: after pointing out something, if the other person approves of it, it's better to set an example by demonstrating what he thinks or showing what he thinks, rather than just trying to convince the other person of what he should do.
