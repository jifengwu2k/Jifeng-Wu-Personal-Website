# Original (Chinese)

我们的思维，的确是工程师的思维。这体现在我们日常生活的方方面面：不论是开车，还是做菜，还是写代码，还是制定计划，我们总是会非常关注计划，关注流程，关注优化，关注总结，关注反馈；而我们的头脑没有那么敏捷，不擅长理论创新——我们是罗马人，而非希腊人。

我们不应该误入理论创新的歧途。是的，我们确实对理论很感兴趣，但是那种兴趣不是形而上的对理论本身的兴趣，而是对理论有何价值以及如何落地的兴趣。

当下的热点是什么？我们应该如何结合某个具体的工业背景，有效而创造性地运用那些理论解决现实问题。这应该是我们的主业。而去研究理论，并思考如何创造性地使用它们，是我们的副业与兴趣爱好。

# Translation (DeepL.com)

Our minds are, indeed, the minds of engineers. This is reflected in every aspect of our daily lives: whether we are driving, cooking, writing code, or making plans, we will always pay great attention to the plan, to the process, to the optimization, to the summary, and to the feedback; and our minds are not as agile and not as good at theoretical innovation - we are Romans, not Greeks!

We shouldn't get sidetracked into theoretical innovation. Yes, we do have an interest in theory, but that interest is not metaphysical interest in the theory itself, it is interest in what the theory is worth and how it can be implemented.

What are the hot topics of the moment? How should we effectively and creatively apply those theories to solve real-world problems in a specific industrial context. That should be our main business. Studying theories and thinking about how to use them creatively is our side project and hobby.
