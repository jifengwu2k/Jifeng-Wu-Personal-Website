## Freedom & Perception

> The best slave is the one who thinks he is free.

> Every accusation is a confession.

## Change & Action

> Philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point, however, is to change it.

## Vision & Strategy

> 左牵黄，右擎苍，锦帽貂裘，千骑卷平冈。

> 不谋万世者，不足谋一时；不谋全局者，不足谋一域。

> It is hallowed by no traditions; it is hampered by none. Its finger posts all point forward.

> 剧是必须从序幕开始的，但序幕还不是高潮。

> 一张白纸，没有负担，好写最新最美的文字，好画最新最美的画图。

> ……结合各自具体实际开拓创新，特别是在前沿实践、未知领域，鼓励大胆探索、敢为人先，寻求有效解决新矛盾新问题的思路和办法，努力创造可复制、可推广的新鲜经验。

## Practical Wisdom & Problem Solving

> Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.

> Premature optimization is the root of all evil.

> The biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin. 
> 
> Building in how we think we think does not work in the long run.
> 
> The only thing that matters in the long run is the leveraging of computation.
> 
> AI researchers have often tried to build knowledge into their agents, this always helps in the short term, and is personally satisfying to the researcher, but in the long run it plateaus and even inhibits further progress, and breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation by search and learning.
> 
> The eventual success is tinged with bitterness, and often incompletely digested, because it is success over a favored, human-centric approach.
