## 关于今后健身习惯的保持与身体素质的提升的若干思考

在今后漫长的人生之路上，我们要让健身成为一种像散步、跑步、爬山一样深入我们日常生活并且随时都有心情做的消遣活动。

结合我们初高中时期跑步、跳绳、坐位体前屈通过强制性的体育课逐渐成为我们习惯去做并能在不断进步中获得成就感的活动这样一段经历，**我们也可以充分利用我们在UBC的最后一学期，每一次去学校学习时，在离开之前尽可能去一趟健身房——且不论时间长短，但还是尽可能去一趟**。近日的实践证明，在脑力劳动之后，这样的“体力劳动”在有效缓解我们精神上的疲惫感的同时，又有助于提升我们的身体素质，可谓一举两得。

与之相伴的另一个问题是如何在坚持健身的同时在力量上取得突破。如果有人陪伴我们锻炼，那么这将不是一个难题。但当我们一个人锻炼的时候，我们又将怎么做呢？我们或许也可以从初高中时期独自练习跑步、跳绳、坐位体前屈的经历中获得灵感。

首先，我们必须有耐心。进步必定是一个漫长的过程，这个过程急不得。

其次，我们可以做到以巩固为主，提升为辅——在一段较长的时间段内，尽可能做到不倒退，稳扎稳打，保持并巩固当前来之不易的训练成果。为此，我们需要记录我们做各项锻炼是我们能接受的最大强度，从而做到每次锻炼时心中有数。

最后，还要时不时像扰动一样尝试突破自己能接受的最大强度。每一次的突破，哪怕只能做一两下，都将成为我们下一阶段巩固的目标。

## Some thoughts on maintaining fitness habits and improving physical fitness in the future

In the long road of life ahead, we want to make fitness a pastime that is as deep into our daily lives as walking, running, and hiking and that we are always in the mood to do.

Combined with our experiences in junior and senior high school, where running, jumping rope, and seated forward bends became habitual through mandatory gym classes, and we gained a sense of accomplishment through continuous improvement,**we can also make the most of our last semester at UBC, and make it a point to go to the gym every time we go to school before we leave - regardless of the length of time**. Recently, it has been proven that this kind of "physical labor" effectively relieves our mental fatigue and improves our physical fitness after mental work, so it is a double win.

Another issue with this is how to make a breakthrough in strength while staying fit. If we have someone to accompany us in our workouts, then this will not be a problem. But what will we do when we work out alone? We might also draw inspiration from our middle and high school years when we practiced running, jumping rope, and seated forward bends alone.

First, we must be patient. Progress is bound to be a long process that cannot be rushed.

Secondly, we can do this by consolidating and improving - as much as possible over a longer period- without regressing, building steadily, maintaining and consolidating our current hard-won training gains. To do this, we need to keep track of the maximum intensity we are comfortable with each workout so that we can be mindful of what we do each time we work out.

Finally, from time to time, we must also try to break through the maximum intensity that we can accept, just like a perturbation. Each breakthrough, even if we can only do one or two reps, will be our goal for the next consolidation phase.
