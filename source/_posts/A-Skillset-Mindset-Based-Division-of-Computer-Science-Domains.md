excerpt: Computer Science is traditionally organized into academic subdisciplines such as Algorithms, Programming Languages, Systems, and Human-Computer Interaction. However, these subjects often misalign with the interdisciplinary skill clusters required in practice. This outline proposes a new, skillset- and mindset-based division of Computer Science domains, reflecting how practitioners apply knowledge and solve real-world problems. To the best of my knowledge, no previously published framework systematically divides Computer Science domains primarily by skillset or cognitive approach.
