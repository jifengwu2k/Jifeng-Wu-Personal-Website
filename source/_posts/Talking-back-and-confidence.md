# Original (Chinese)

一个人在听到建议的时候喜欢顶嘴，有叛逆心理，某种意义上是想要证明自己，挽回一些自尊与自信，但又暂时没有强大的以自身实力为基础的自信。面对这种情形，我们虽然会不太舒服，但最好不要顶回去，或者是尝试说服对方，这些只会让对方感到更不愉快，进而也让自己感到更不愉快，既不治标也不治本。更好的做法是去承受，去服输，去退一步，不争了，而是借对方的某个观点转移话题——给对方认可、自信与陪伴，和对方一起去进步，去提升，去做需要做的事情。

# Translation (DeepL.com)

A person who likes to talk back when they hear a suggestion has a rebellious mentality and, in a sense, wants to prove themselves to regain some self-esteem and self-confidence, but for the time being, does not have a robust and deep-rooted self-confidence based on their strength. Although we will be uncomfortable in this situation, it is best not to talk back or try to persuade the other party. These will only make the other party feel more unpleasant and, in turn, make themselves feel more unpleasant - solving neither the symptoms nor the root cause of the problem. The better thing to do is to suffer, to give in, to step back, not to argue, but to take advantage of one of the other person's points to change the subject - to give the other person recognition, self-confidence, and companionship, and together with the other person to progress, to improve, to do what needs to be done.
