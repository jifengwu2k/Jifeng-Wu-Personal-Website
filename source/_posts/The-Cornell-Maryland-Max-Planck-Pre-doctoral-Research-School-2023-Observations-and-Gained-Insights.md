## Panel Session 2: "Research in industry vs. academia"

### Problem Focus & Recognition

- Industry tends to focus on concrete problems.
- In academia, broader issues are often addressed.
- Authorship and credit in academia is complex. It's not a zero-sum game. It's not just about who is first or second author; giving credit to students doesn't mean professors won't get any.

### Publication & Quality

- The emphasis is on publishing fewer papers but ensuring they are of high quality. It's not about the quantity but the impact and quality of the papers.
- The first, last, or best paper on a topic are the most influential.

### Career Path

- Before securing a tenure professor position, many go through multiple postdocs and even stints as industrial research scientists.
- Only about 10-20% of PhDs eventually become faculty.
- Some research scientists find academic-like environments within the right industry groups.  

### Factors Differentiating Academia and Industry:

- Industrial research must eventually have some commercial value.
- In academia, there are constraints like obtaining funding, student recruitment, and equipment acquisition.
- Academics have better job security and can rebound from mistakes.
- Industry doesn't need to chase grants or funding in the same way academia does.

### Skills & Transitions

- Transferring skills between departments or companies is straightforward.
- Transitioning between academia and industry is often a one-way street. It's challenging to return to academia from industry unless one maintains a consistent publishing record and works on research-valued projects.

### Geographical and Topic Mobility

Researchers are encouraged to be flexible, moving across countries and topics.  

### Work-Life Balance

- Systems vary across locations.
- Enforce personal boundaries and learn to say no.
- A balance doesn't mean absence of stress. In the industry, even if the work-life balance is okay, stress may arise from working on undesired projects or facing peer pressure.
- Find people who become friends with you.

### Two-Body Problem

It's more of an issue in academia than in industry since it's easier to change companies than academic institutions.

### Personality and Approach

- Industry caters to hackers and those interested in tooling.
- Academics focus on research and higher purposes and see coding as a tool. Effective communication, including selling your idea in proposals and talks, is vital.

### Startups vs. PhD Journey

- Both require a significant commitment, typically around 6-8 years to IPO.
- Startups demand full devotion, often with little to no work-life balance.

### Funding & Tenure

- If a grant from a company fails, there will be no direct legal consequences, but the likelihood of getting another might be reduced.
- Tenure provides a basic salary and job security, but researchers still need to raise funds for their research.
- Doing a job aligned research can be beneficial for dissertation and future career opportunities.

- Graphs are ubiquitous structures. Implementing high-performance graph algorithms speeds up scientific discovery.
- I don't work on dense graphs. Real-world graphs are sparse, and I haven't seen a dense graph in practice in 10 years.
- I focus on shared-memory algorithms and don't recommend programming supercomputers until you have to.
- Recommended reading: [**Scalability! But at what COST?**](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/hotos15/hotos15-paper-mcsherry.pdf)
- Should batch updates to dynamic graphs
	- More parallelism
	- Reduces the cost of each update
- Representing adjacency information using purely functional trees are safe for concurrency.

## [Guest Lecture: Yiting Xia](https://cloud.mpi-sws.org/index.php/s/n97WnKRxgYoLcCL?dir=undefined&openfile=84146671)

- There are different available connections at different time slices.
- Precomputing routes and handling link failure is still work in progress.

### [Lorenzo Alvisi](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/lorenzo-alvisi)

#### Cultivating an Academic Sense

- To nurture an academic mindset, one should assess how an individual performs when faced with a problem.
- He mentioned the "Dijkstra club" at UT Austin as an example.
- Emphasized the significance of "beautiful work" and that it's crucial for individuals to produce work of beauty and quality.
- Observing and learning from the endeavors of others is beneficial.

#### Life's Blueprint

- Life does not come with a set map but rather a compass for direction.
- Professor Alvisi never limited his imagination about his capabilities.
- Guiding principles in life:
    - Seeking personal happiness.
    - Maintaining healthy relationships.
    - Pursuing a fulfilling job that combines happiness with challenges.
- Acceptance of uncertain outcomes: One might not always know if they will succeed or fail.
- The importance of personal growth: Find joy in self-improvement.
- Shared personal experience of pursuing two Ph.D. degrees, the first of which was at an institution he didn't particularly favor. Highlighted that struggles are often hidden from view.

#### Career Perspectives

- One's career doesn't necessarily peak at a fixed point; there's always potential for growth, including entering academia.
- Career choices are not always black and white; it depends on personal preferences and aspirations, such as seeking excellent opportunities close to home.
- Consider the duration of your investments in particular career choices. Not every commitment needs to be long-term.

#### Balancing Hobbies and Work

- Prof. Alvisi shared advice from his mentor's mentor about integrating hobbies into professional life.
- While he had diverse interests, he made sacrifices to focus on computer science due to his intellectual capacities. Some hobbies were too time-consuming.
- Emphasized the importance of hobbies as they provide a necessary balance and maintain mental well-being.

#### Addressing the Two-Body Problem

- Universities recognize the challenge when both partners in a relationship are professionals.
- If partners excel in different domains, there's potential for both to be hired with attractive incentives.
- Solutions include proactive planning, alternating priorities between partners over the years, and considering remote work opportunities.

#### Other Insights

- Mentioned the Sloan Fellowship as a notable achievement before tenure.
- Advised young professionals to delay specialization as long as possible. Explore various options.
- Encouraged students to seek advice from multiple professors to gain a diverse range of opinions and insights.

## [Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee (2nd Lecture)](https://cloud.mpi-sws.org/index.php/s/n97WnKRxgYoLcCL?dir=undefined&openfile=84146671)

- There are six activities of daily living (ADLs) defined in literature: personal hygiene or grooming, dressing, toileting, transferring or ambulating, and eating
- Anomaly detection is used in processing sensor data.
- A* is widely used in motion planning due to its efficiency and optimality (it never overestimates the cost).
- Motion planning time = search time + collision checking time (~90%). Therefore, the author proposed lazy A* (which finds an optimal path in an unconstrained situation, goes over collision checking while on the path, and re-searches a path if a collision is encountered).
- Collect a dataset before embarking on research.
- To understand how to manipulate different kinds of foods, the author created a *food manipulation taxonomy*.
- Choose hardware components for real-world deployability.
- Use deformation of points on a gel coupled with computer vision algorithms to measure shear force
- Add *structure* to machine learning algorithms to overcome a lack of data.
- If integrating multimodal data sources, think of *where* to integrate as the size or magnitude of different data may be inconsistent.
- A "bandit" algorithm is an RL algorithm where we utilize *partial feedback* of *one step* in the decision-making process, unlike conventional RL algorithms with "episodes" spanning multiple steps.

### Audience question: How to stay up-to-date with the state-of-the-art (especially in the fast-changing landscape of machine learning)?

- One of the main tasks of faculty life
- Look at titles and abstracts of publications in all well-known conferences.
- Organize reading groups and reading sessions.
- Interact with known other research groups.

## [Derek Dreyer: How to write papers and give talks that people can follow](https://cloud.mpi-sws.org/index.php/s/n97WnKRxgYoLcCL?dir=undefined&openfile=84146671)

- Many papers suffer from the TMI (too much information) problem.
- Aim at giving *constructive principles* that are easy to check and fix.
- A paper is different from a textbook - people *aren't as committed to reading a paper as they are to reading a textbook*.
- A *good but not interesting* paper tends to get a "B" or a "weak accept."
- Putting the Related Work section at the front (as opposed to in the back before the Conclusion) may hinder unfamiliar authors from understanding your work.

- Most people *don't listen to talks to determine whether they should read a paper*. Instead, they listen to talks to discuss with others. The main goal of a talk is to *give people positive feelings about your work*.
- A talk should only cover the *intro* and *key ideas* sections of the corresponding paper.
- The *key ideas* should be the high point in your talk before presenting the takeaway messages.
- Add visual elements to emphasize *one point* per slide.
- Use smooth animations to help the listener follow.
